# WeatherApp

Languages used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Skills learn: API, array filtering from JSON files, creating and removing divs dynamically. Flexbox, and expansions on the CSS skills. 


Weather app is my first experience with API's. Had thoughts of expanding on various sub-projects. Could do this futher. 

Using a basic free API, I managed to pull information from the API and present it on a web page.
