# WeatherApp

Languages used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Skills learn: API, and website design


Weather app is my first experience with API's

Using a basic free API, I managed to pull information from the API and present it on a web page.

Further things to add to the application:

- Pulling more days down, and presenting multiple days.
- More Styling
- Options for celcius and farenheit.
